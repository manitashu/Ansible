#RabbitMQ comes with a default username / password as guest/guest. But this user cannot be used to connect. Hence we need to create one user for the application.
#
#Create application user
## rabbitmqctl add_user roboshop roboshop123
## rabbitmqctl set_user_tags roboshop administrator
## rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / roboshop ".*" ".*" ".*"
